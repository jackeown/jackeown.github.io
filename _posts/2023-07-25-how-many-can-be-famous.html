<h1>How many people can be famous?</h1>

<p>
    Many people look to influencers/content creators/celebrities and wish to emulate their
    success in gaining a large following and making a living off of their content, but 
    how many people can actually achieve fame?
    In order to answer this question, you first have to define what it means to be famous.
    I think a good and flexible definition is that a <em>large number</em> of people <em>know you</em>.
    Unfortunately this raises the followup questions of "How large of a number?" and "What counts as knowing someone?".    
    Let's call people $n$-famous if they are known by at least $n$% of the people in a given population.
    Let's also put an upper-limit, $k$, on the number of people each person can <em>know</em> (by whatever definition you choose for "knowing" someone).
    Interestingly, $k$ and a population size is all it takes to put an upper-bound on how many people can be $n$-famous.
</p>


<p>
The number of people in a population of size $p$ that can be $n$-famous I hereby with as the following formula:
$$ fame(n,k,p)=\dfrac{100kp}{np} $$

This can be thought of as each person having $k$ "slots" in their brain for people they can know.
In total, a population of size $p$ then has $kp$ slots altogether.
Each person who is $n$-famous takes up at least $\frac{np}{100}$ of these slots.
The maximum number of $n$-famous people is achieved by assuming that each $n$-famous person takes up <em>exactly</em>
$\frac{np}{100}$ slots. It doesn't matter if the audiences of two $n$-famous people are disjoint or not, because the total number of slots
occupied is the same regardless.

</p>

<p>
    Here's a calculator you can use to play around with the formula:
    In the sliders below, $n$ ranges from 1 to 100, $k$ ranges from 1 to 50,000, and $p$ ranges from 1 to 8 billion.

$p$:
