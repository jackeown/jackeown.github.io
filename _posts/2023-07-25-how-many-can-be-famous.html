<h1>How many people can be famous?</h1>

<p>
    Many people look to influencers/content creators/celebrities and wish to emulate their
    success in gaining a large following and making a living off of their content, but 
    how many people can actually achieve fame?
    In order to answer this question, you first have to define what it means to be famous.
    I think a good and flexible definition is that a <em>large number</em> of people <em>know you</em>.
    Unfortunately this raises the followup questions of "How large of a number?" and "What counts as knowing someone?".    
    Let's call people \(n\)-famous if they are known by at least \(n\)% of the people in a given population.
    Let's also put an upper-limit, \(k\), on the number of people each person can <em>know</em> (by whatever definition you choose for "knowing" someone).
    Interestingly, \(k\) and a population size is all it takes to put an upper-bound on how many people can be \(n\)-famous.
</p>


<p>
The number of people in a population of size \(p\) that can be \(n\)-famous I hereby with as the following formula:
$$ fame(n,k,p)=\dfrac{100kp}{np} $$

This can be thought of as each person having \(k\) "slots" in their brain for people they can know.
In total, a population of size \(p\) then has $kp$ slots altogether.
Each person who is \(n\)-famous takes up at least \(\frac{np}{100}\) of these slots.
The maximum number of \(n\)-famous people is achieved by assuming that each \(n\)-famous person takes up <em>exactly</em>
\(\frac{np}{100}\) slots. It doesn't matter if the audiences of two \(n\)-famous people are disjoint or not, because the total number of slots
occupied is the same regardless.

</p>

<p>
    Here's a calculator you can use to play around with the formula:
    In the sliders below, \(1\leq n\leq 100\), \(1\leq k\leq 50000\), and \(1\leq p\leq 8\; billion\).
